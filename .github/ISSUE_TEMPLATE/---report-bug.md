<!-- Thank you for taking the time to report a new issue.

Before reporting a new issue:

1. Use genuine builds of Nuvola available from <https://nuvola.tiliado.eu>.
    If you use a third-party build, contact your distributor to get help.
    We don't have resources to support packages we know nothing about.
2. Use the latest release of Nuvola. Update often, Flatpak updates are safe.
    Run  "flatpak update --system; flatpak update --user" to make sure
    all your Nuvola packages are up-to-date.
