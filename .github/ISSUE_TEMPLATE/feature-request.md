**Please describe in detail what you would like to solve with the proposed feature:**

Replace this example: When I click a close button of the Nuvola window, music stops playing and Nuvola quits.
I'd prefer Nuvola to keep playing in the background instead.


**Do you have an idea how it could be solved and how it should look like?**

Replace this example: Please add new settings "Run in background when the window is closed" with three options:
"Always"/"When music is playing (default)"/"Never".
